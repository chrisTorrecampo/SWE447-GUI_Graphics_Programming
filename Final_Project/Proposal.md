After looking at some THREE.js examples and documentation, I believe that the following project is both doable and showcasese my skills I learned from the semester

Overview:
I want to implement something similar to a THREE.js project where a user can rotate a city block with some sort of control. My version would be similar, but I intend to add more objects into the scene, such as a sun, possibly a bird or plane, and so on. These extra objects would rotate around the city block. In order to rotate the city, users would be able to use the mouse. Extra functionality can be added, such as buttons to change the time of day.

Steps:
Week 1- Learn THREE.js
Week 2- Construct the city block
Week 3- Finish Constructing the city block and basic programming; Construct the Sun and functionality.
Week 4- Construct the birds and plane and functionality.
Week 5- Implement user controls; Finish any unfinished tasks

Implementation:
I plan on creating this project with THREE.js
